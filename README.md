==============

This repo is a strictly a proof of concept. I am using Backbone to hit Etsy's API to fetch some painting listings and then organizing them into collections (expensive items vs. cheap items) using different query string parameters in the Collection URL. 

The idea was to gather some paintings, and then create a 'quiz' that juxtaposes an expensive painting and a cheap painting, and have the user see if they could discern which is more expensive. I never implemented user response, but got Backbone to fetch items from Etsy, shuffle them, and then renderpairs of 'quiz items.'

I will be starting a new repo and polishing this idea into a fully functional site.
